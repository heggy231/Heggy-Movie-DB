# Goal of Heggy-Movie-DB:

- [ ] API URL similar to [the Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/json-and-jsonp)

- [ ] Create a API endpoint that return JSON data back to the user.

  - version 1: hardcoded JSON data
  - version 2: a database with backend code to covert it to JSON

- [ ] Protect access to your API by providing API keys to users and verify that the key is valid whenever API call is made.

  - This ensures only authorized users can access your API. (potentially, I could charge money)
  - Protect data from unauthorized usage.
  - Track the usage of your API endpoints.

- [ ] Be able to create changes to my API without breaking the already existing API endpoints.
